## 🌍 **Key Projects:**

- **Cross-Domain Mental Health Detection (NLP):** Trained classifiers on depression tweets and evaluated them on suicidal ideation data, comparing TF-IDF, RoBERTa, and MentalBERT across 6 classifiers — finding that embedding quality is the dominant factor in cross-domain transfer.

- **Crime Count Forecasting per District (Big Data & Regression):** Built a regression pipeline using Apache Spark to forecast crime volume per district across nearly 1 million Chicago crime records, enabling proactive resource allocation and public safety planning.

- **Predicting Employee Attrition:** Built an ensemble machine learning model to predict employee turnover with 89% accuracy and 0.80 ROC-AUC, enabling proactive retention strategies and reducing organizational costs.

- **Liver Disease Prediction:** Developed machine learning models for early detection of liver disease, improving diagnostic accuracy through feature engineering and model comparison across multiple classifiers.

- **Social Media & Mental Health:** Analyzed the relationship between social media usage and mental well-being using data analytics and visualization, identifying behavioral patterns linked to negative health outcomes.
